### Node types

- Technology
- Concept
- Decision (ADR)
- Requirement
- Constraint
- Evidence (subtypes: Doc, News, Repo, Ticket, MeetingNote, Benchmark)
- Experiment
- Metric
- Risk, Incident
- Team, Person

### Relationship types (directed →)

- SUPPORTS (Evidence → Decision|Technology) { weight, confidence, timestamp }
- CONTRADICTS (Evidence → Decision|Technology) { weight, confidence, timestamp }
- IMPLEMENTS (Technology → Concept|Requirement)
- ALTERNATIVE_OF (Technology ↔ Technology) { overlap, tradeoff_vector }
- DEPENDS_ON (Technology → Technology) { criticality }
- ADDRESSES (Decision|Technology → Requirement)
- VIOLATES (Technology|Decision → Constraint)
- OBSERVED_IN (Metric|Experiment → Evidence|Incident)
- OWNED_BY (Technology|Decision|Evidence → Team|Person)

### Property conventions

- Common: `id` (internal), `created_at`, `updated_at`, `visibility` (public|team|confidential)
- Evidence: `title`, `url`, `source`, `published_at`, `hash`
- Decision: `status` (accepted|proposed|superseded), `context`, `options`, `decision`, `consequences`
- Metric: domain-specific keys (e.g., `p95_latency`, `error_rate`, `slo`)

### Naming conventions

- Labels: PascalCase (e.g., `Technology`, `Decision`).
- Relationship types: UPPER_SNAKE (e.g., `SUPPORTS`, `DEPENDS_ON`).
- Properties: lower_snake (e.g., `published_at`, `tradeoff_vector`).

### Uniqueness/identity guidance

- Evidence: MERGE by `url`; persist content `hash` and `published_at` for versioning.
- Technology/Concept/Requirement: MERGE by human-stable keys (e.g., `name` or `key`).
