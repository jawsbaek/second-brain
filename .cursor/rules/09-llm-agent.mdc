description: "LLM agent I/O: prompt template, tools, output formatting, and source-grounding rules."
---

### Prompt template essentials

- Include: user query + summarized requirements/constraints + graph query results (candidates, tradeoffs) + evidence snippets with links/dates/trust.
- Rule: never guess without sources; say "unknown" if insufficient evidence.

### Agent tools

- graph.search(cypher, params)
- vector.search(query, k)
- evidence.get(chunk_ids)
- decision.create/update(ADR)

### Output

- Top-N recommendations with adopt/hold/alternative rationale.
- Always include source links and dates; generate ADR draft for review.
