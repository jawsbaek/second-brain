description: "High-level goals and principles for the decision-centric knowledge graph."

### Goals

- Build a decision engine that models knowledge as nodes–relations–distance to enable: (1) fast exploration/summarization, (2) decision support (technology choices/tradeoffs), (3) rigorous, citable RAG context for LLMs.

### Principles

- Every fact must have a source (link + snapshot hash) and time (created/updated/observed).
- Distances are modeled via relation properties: weight encodes trust/relevance and combines with time decay and trust to compute effective distance.
- Automated extraction (NER/RE) must feed a human review loop (approve/edit) before graph acceptance.
- Fine-grained ABAC enforces security at node/edge/field level.

### Distance interpretation

- Effective distance is smaller when evidence is recent, trustworthy, and relevant. Closer items carry more decision weight.

### Current repository anchor(s)

- Docker composition lives at [second-brain/docker/docker-compose.yml](mdc:second-brain/docker/docker-compose.yml)
